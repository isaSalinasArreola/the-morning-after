      title: 'What is emergency contraception?',
      content: `It is a form of birth control that prevents pregnancy after sex. It's sometimes called "the morning after pill."
      Emergency contraceptive needs to be taken immediately after sex (or up to 5 days after having intercourse).
      Remember: the sooner you take an EC, the more effective it is!`
    },
    {
      title: 'What are my EC options?',
      content: `There are two types of EC: EC pills (like Plan B) and a Copper-T IUD. EC pills are widely available over the counter at most pharmacies.
      A copper IUD needs to be inserted by a physician within 5 days of unprotected sex.`
    },
    {
      title: 'How does the pill work?',
      content: `There are two types of emergency contraceptive pills: plan B and ella.
      Plan B delivers levonorgestrel (a synthetic progestin, a hormone your body naturally produces) to delay ovulation.
      Ella contains ulipristal, which delays ovulation and makes it difficult for the egg to embed in the uterus.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Is the pill an abortion pill?',
        content: `NO. EC pills like Plan B and ella work by DELAYING ovulation or making it difficult for the egg to embed in the uters.
        This means that the sperm and egg never meet -- it stops pregnancy from happening. If you are already pregnant, the pill will not work.
        `
    },
    {
        title: 'What is the difference between plan B and ella?',
        content: `Plan B uses levonorgestrel -- the same active ingredient in long term birth control and is more effective the
        sooner you take it. Ella is just as effective up to 5 days after having unprotected sex and is just as effective
         on day 5 as it is on day 1.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Where can I get the pill?',
        content: `There are many brands of levonorgestrel-based EC that you can buy over the counter including: Plan B,
        My Way, My Choice, Take Action, and Aftera. Ella is perscription only in Texas which means it needs to be prescribed 
        from a doctor and then purchased at the pharmacy.
        `
      },
      {
        title: 'How expensive is the pill?',
        content: `The brand Plan B can be expensive - $40 to $60 - but other generic brands like My Choice and My Way
        are usually cheaper - around $20 - and are just as effective.

        title: 'What if I do not have $$$ for the pill?',
        content: `There are FREE EC providers across Texas. Check out our free organization table to check out organizations that will do delivery or pickup
        in your area and provide EC at NO COST. Your local Title X clinics will also likely offer low cost or free EC.

      {
        title: 'Do I need to go to the store to get the pill?',
        content: `No! You can use the pharmacy drive-through to purchase the pill or use a pharmacy's pick-up options.
        There are also apps that will deliver it, like Postmates, Favor, Instacart, and Amazon.

      {
        title: 'Can I use EC as a regular form of birth control?',
        content: `EC pills are short-term solutions. The high dose of hormones in the pill is safe is to take occasionally
        but can cause side effects if taken frequently. The best way to prevent pregnancy is still condoms and other forms of birth control.

      {
        title: 'Does Plan B work for everyone?',
        content: `Unfortunately, no. Plan B and other EC pills are less effective in people who weigh over 176 lbs.
        Some doctors recommend you take 2 pills instead of 1 if you are over 176 lbs.`
